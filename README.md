- 👋 Hi, I’m Aditya! I'm a first-year PhD student in Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things to do with mathematical and computational efficiency in astronomy code, mostly using Julia (but I'm also looking for an excuse to learn Rust).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on describing exoplanet atmospheres in unified models that can be run at different complexity scales, and simulating astronomical instruments and matching them to lab results!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with scientific efficiency: if you're an astronomer/physicist thinking "I wish I could make (thing I'm working with) faster", get in touch!
- 📫 You can email me at adityars at ucsc dot edu, or find me on Twitter at @adiastra99 or on Mastodon at @adiastra@astrodon.social.
